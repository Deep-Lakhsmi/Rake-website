## üöÄ Project Overview

**Rack Website** is a basic web application that I created as part of my internship to learn more about web development and design. The goal was to build a responsive, user-friendly site with key functionalities for displaying information, interacting with users, and laying the groundwork for further development.

### Features (so far):
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Basic Layout**: A clean, minimalist layout with focus on usability.
- **Interactive Elements**: Features like forms, buttons, and a navbar to explore the basics of front-end interactions.

## üõ† Tech Stack

The website was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: For basic webpage structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality.
- **VS Code**: Primary code editor.
- **GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting.
